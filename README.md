# Project Description

Everybody loves the good old classic game snake! 
In this project, we further enhance the game by adding a brand new online mode for 2 players to compete with each other! 
In addition to the 2 player multiplayer, we also have some other creativity with the snake game that will
enhance the gameplay compared to the original snake game. This includes some items that extended
from the original foods in the snake game. 

The game mechanics for snake game 2 will be the same from the original snake game. Here, Snake game 2 multiplayer will extend the basic, original mechanics and add interesting features and multiplayer mechanics as described above. 
The brand new multiplayer mechanics will allow players to have a thoughtful experience and have lots of fun.
The objective of this creative snake game is to use the Java programming concepts, including the multiplayer networking,
the Model, View, Controller design and Object-oriented principles.
